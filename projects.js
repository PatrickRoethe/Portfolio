                    <br><strong>Experiences</strong>
                    <p>I worked on the "About Us" page for a group project creating a photography website. We chose this project because a team member had preexisting ideas and content. Despite initial overcomplications with JavaScript, I learned to simplify my approach. We faced challenges like coordinating schedules and aligning coding styles. Effective communication and regular SPRINT meetings improved our workflow, revealing that team members are valuable resources and great aids. This project highlighted the importance of planning, communication, collaboration, and balancing ambition with practicality. Moving forward, I aim to enhance my efficiency, task management, and planning skills in web development.</p>

      description: `
                    This project is a website for a science center themed around the universe and space, collaboratively developed by Kenneth Sheikh and Patrick Røthe. The site comprises 4-6 main pages, featuring an engaging animation on the start page and a checkout section. Key features include a start page animation of Earth orbiting the sun, responsive design through media queries, a user-friendly dropdown menu, and seamless button navigation linking to respective pages. The primary technologies used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    <br><strong>Experiences</strong>
                    <p>Developing this science center website has been an immensely enriching experience in web development. Working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with several key aspects of modern web design, including creating responsive layouts, implementing engaging animations, and developing intuitive navigation systems. Collaborating with Kenneth Sheikh, each of us took responsibility for at least two pages, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive final product. The project also involved making thoughtful design decisions aimed at creating a kid-friendly and educational platform. While the current version of the website meets our initial goals, we recognize areas for improvement and plan to make further enhancements post-delivery. This experience has significantly broadened my skills, particularly in collaborative development and dynamic design, and I will continue to revisit and refine the project to keep my competencies up to date.</p>

                  This project is a blog platform that allows users to create, edit, and manage posts. The platform includes functionalities for user authentication, post creation, and content management, leveraging an API for handling blog posts. The project is currently under development, with further features such as pagination, sorting, and more down the pipeline. Additionally, it includes a function that detects login status and adjusts the navigation bar accordingly.
                  <br><strong>Experiences</strong>
                  <p>Developing this blog platform has been an enriching learning experience in web development. The project incorporates several key functions, including user authentication, post creation, and content management, as well as implementing secure user login mechanisms. Working extensively with APIs has been a critical component, enhancing my understanding of dynamic data interactions. These functions are widely used in modern web applications, making this project a valuable addition to my portfolio. I will continue to revisit and refine the code to ensure my skills and knowledge remain up to date.</p>
